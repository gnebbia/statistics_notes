1. Which of the below data sets has the lowest standard deviation? You do not
   need to calculate the exact standard deviations to answer this question.

   0,1,2,3,4,5,6

   0, 25, 50, 100, 125, 150, 1000

   100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 101 OK

   0,1,3,3,3,5,6

2. True or False: The statistic mean/median (mean divided by median) can be used
   as a measure of skewness (either right or left). Suppose we are dealing with
   a distribution where the minimum is 0.5. If this statistic (mean/median) is
   less than 1, the distribution is most likely left skewed.
    
    True

3. True or False: You are going to collect income data from a right-skewed
   distribution of incomes of politicians. If you take a large enough sample
   from that distribution, the sample mean and the sample median will always
   have the same value.

    False

4. True or False: A mosaic plot is useful for visualizing the relationship
   between a numerical and a categorical variable.

    False

5. Does meditation cure insomnia? Researchers randomly divided 400 people into
   two equal- sized groups. One group meditated daily for 30 minutes, the other
   group attended a 2-hour information session on insomnia. At the beginning of
   the study, the average difference between the number of minutes slept between
   the two groups was about 0. After the study, the average difference was about
   32 minutes, and the meditation group had a higher average number of minutes
   slept. To test whether an average difference of 32 minutes could be
   attributed to chance, a statistics student decided to conduct a randomization
   test. She wrote the number of minutes slept by each subject in the study on
   an index card. She shuffled the cards together very well, and then dealt them
   into two equal-sized groups. Which of the following best describes the
   outcome?
   
   The average difference between the two stacks of cards will be about 0
   minutes. OK, because she shuffled again the groups, so the one which were
   sleeping more will go a little bit in one group and a little bit in the other
   group

   If meditation is effective, the average difference between the two stacks of
   cards will be more than 32 minutes.

   The average difference between the two stacks of cards will be about 32
   minutes.
